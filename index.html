                            <img src="Maldives.jpg" alt="my image"width="1000">
                            <p>Maldives, in full Republic of Maldives, also called Maldive Islands,
                                 independent island country in the north-central Indian Ocean.
                                  It consists of a chain of about 1,200 small coral islands and 
                                  sandbanks (some 200 of which are inhabited), grouped in clusters,
                                   or atolls.
                                Maldives
                                The islands extend more than 510 miles (820 km) from north to south
                                 and 80 miles (130 km) from east to west. The northernmost atoll is 
                                 about 370 miles (600 km) south-southwest of the Indian mainland,
                                  and the central area, including the capital island of Male (Male’), 
                                  is about 400 miles (645 km) southwest of Sri Lanka.The Maldive Islands 
                                  are a series of coral atolls built up from the crowns of a submerged
                                   ancient volcanic mountain range. All the islands are low-lying, none 
                                   rising to more than 6 feet (1.8 metres) above sea level. Barrier reefs
                                    protect the islands from the destructive effects of monsoons.
                                     The rainy season, from May to August, is brought by the southwest monsoon;
                                      from December to March the northeast monsoon brings dry and mild winds.
                                       The average annual temperature varies from 76 to 86 °F (24 to 30 °C). 
                                       Rainfall averages about 84 inches (2,130 mm) per year. The atolls have 
                                       sandy beaches, lagoons, and a luxuriant growth of coconut palms,
                                        together with breadfruit trees and tropical bushes. Fish abound in 
                                        the reefs, lagoons, and seas adjoining the islands; sea turtles are 
                                        caught for food and for their oil, a traditional medicine.</p>
                                    <h2>SWITZERLAND</h2>    
                                    <img src="Switzerland1.jpg" alt="my image"width="1000">
                                    <p>Switzerland is considered a traditional country for tourism.
                                         Switzerland is famous for its incredible diversity—natural and cultural. 
                                         Mountains, famous lakes, and alpine meadows have attracted visitors 
                                         for hundreds of years. And the possibility of talking with residents in 
                                         4 languages ​​practically removes the language barrier.

                                        The idea of ​​Switzerland as the most peaceful country in 
                                        the world is usually formed. Indeed, the Confederate government 
                                        tries to maintain neutrality in any military conflict. But this country
                                         has also seen revolutions (not always bloodless) and several wars.Switzerland 
                                         is famous for its lakes, rivers, mountains, and natural beauty. It is also known 
                                         for its diversity of languages ​​and religions. Switzerland is the only country 
                                         with four national languages ​​and one of those countries where you can go at any 
                                         time and enjoy it in the best way.Switzerland has the most peaks over 4,000 meters,
                                          which earns it the title of “roof of Europe.” Switzerland, the central Alps, is part 
                                          of the mountain massif that stretches through this country. The Alps occupy as much 
                                          as 65% of the territory. There are so many activities you could do, from getting a
                                           cable car to the highest mountain peaks and glaciers, to hiking the mountain trails.</p>
                                           <h2>EGYPT</h2>

                                           <p>Egypt is a land shrouded in mystery. From the ancient
                                             pyramids of Giza to the meandering Nile River - Egypt is
                                              undeniably a place to be adding to your bucket list. This
                                               country has had a varied past. When the Romans set foot in Egypt
                                                over 2000 years ago, the pyramids were already considered to be 
                                                historical ruins. Fast forward to today and layers upon layers of 
                                                history have created a lively melting pot of cultures. But, if you are 
                                                feeling a little green when it comes to the subject of Egyptian history,
                                                 don’t worry. When visiting Egypt, a trip to the Egypt tourist attractions
                                                  provides a whistle-stop tour of the country’s tumultuous past.Egypt’s strategic 
                                                  location in Northern Africa, the country enjoys a mild climate. In the summer, 
                                                  the temperature skyrockets but during the winter, the daytime feels like spring 
                                                  and the nights are cold. The best time to see the Egypt tourist spots is between
                                                   October and April. During these months the temperatures are cooler but it is still
                                                    enjoyably warm to be able to sit on the beach or see all the key sites. The timeless
                                                     and cinematic desert landscapes of Egypt have been left fairly untouched by the hands
                                                      of time. Read on to discover the best things to see in Egypt.</p>
